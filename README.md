# Pilot Weather App

I used JSON Server to server json file, to start it, use following command.
```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
```
I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build this app.
Use following command to build this app.
```bash
  cd pilot
  npm install 
  npm start
```
Now you can see this app in browser.
it is running on http://localhost:3000/
and it's done

in future, I will add more features.
such as, add more cities, add more weather information, add more languages.
as well as onclick even to go to next page and won't open both components.
